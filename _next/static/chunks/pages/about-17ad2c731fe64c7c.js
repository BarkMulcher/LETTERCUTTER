About two-thirds of my work is personal headstones, or memorials. One-third is architectural donor walls, building inscriptions and plaques. My background in calligraphy, typography and graphic design was useful in making the shift to lettering in stone. I also do a fair amount of demonstrating, teaching and exploring the history of the alphabet and letterforms. My daughter Sigrid has been working with me since 2011. Her background in painting, drawing and music lightens my more methodical approach. As an experienced, registered rock-climbing guide, she approaches the material of the stone itself differently, too.
