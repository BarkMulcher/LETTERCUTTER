                    I have been hand-carving fine, inscriptional letters and decorative 
                    motifs in stone since 1988. About two-thirds of my work is personal 
                    headstones, or memorials. One-third is architectural donor walls, 
                    building inscriptions and plaques.
                    My background in calligraphy, typography and graphic design was useful 
                    in making the shift to lettering in stone. I also do a fair amount 
                    of demonstrating, teaching and exploring the history of the alphabet 
                    and letterforms.
                    My daughter Sigrid has been working with me since 2011. Her background 
                    in painting, drawing and music lightens my more methodical approach. 
                    As an experienced, registered rock-climbing guide, she approaches 
                    the material of the stone itself differently, too. We make a good 
                    team and work well together.
