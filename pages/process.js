        <p className="card-body">
          Sigrid and I enjoy carving in slate because it is such a fine-grained 
          stone and shows off beautiful lettering better than any other. 
          The early settlers in New England used whatever slate was easily available 
          and not all of it was of high quality. The black slate of Maine is 
          extremely hard and dark. Slate also comes in purple, green and mottled 
          hues from Vermont. We also frequently work in limestone, marble and granite.

        <h3 className="card-header">FORMING THE LETTERS</h3>
        <p>
        We brush out our letters and other elements calligraphically, fine-tuning 
        the work on paper overlays before transferring the finished design to the 
        face of the stone. Typically, we v-cut letters into the honed surface of 
        the stone, but we sometimes carve raised lettering.
        </p>
        <h3 className="card-header">CUTTING THE SLATE</h3>
        <p className="card-body">
        When it is cut, slate leaves a whitish trail in the letter which naturally 
        enhances readability.  All other stones are best darkened very slightly with 
        an acetone-based, long-lasting stain. If appropriate, gilding in 23K gold or 
        palladium can draw special attention to the lettering. The reflective quality 
        of gilding is especially effective against the dark background of slate.
        </p>
        <h3 className="card-header">CARVER'S TOOLS</h3>
        <p className="card-body">
        A letter carver’s tools are pretty simple. A one-pound hammer drives a carbide-tipped 
        flat chisel against the two faces of the letter in repeating passes starting in the 
        center and moving to the edges. This is called chasing a letter. Granites and 
        some marbles require heavier steel mallets and a more aggressive kind of strike. 
        The decorative work employs a broad range of hand-made chisels, each leaving a 
        different effect in the stone. Sometimes, we will use an air hammer to remove material 
        more quickly when we are creating larger letters, but every letter is finished by hand.
        </p>
        <h3 className="card-header">SETTING THE STONE</h3>
        <p className="card-body">
        Most cemeteries have guidelines to help them ensure the responsible setting of the 
        stones in their care. A few have very strict policies to follow. Our method of installation 
        is generally well-respected and accepted by cemeteries. We pour two reinforced concrete 
        "shoes" that are pinned to the upright stone, spreading the weight and enabling it to rise
        and fall with the deep frosts of New England. It is a simple, non-interventive way of 
        stabilizing an upright memorial and, for our purposes, lets us easily pull the stone later 
        and carve an additional name and date with relative ease.
