                    FATHER AND DAUGHTER WORKING TOGETHER CUTTING STONE IN BELFAST

                    In the 1980's, Douglas Coffin was the art director for a magazine, 
                    and creative director for an ad agency. At 40 years old, his life 
                    changed when he went to a demonstration and seminar about letter 
                    cutting and stone.
                    The Belfast man is now one of a handful in the country doing 
                    something he loves, and his daughter is by his side.
                    "There are only about 25 letter cutters in the country working 
                    at the caliber my daughter and I do, so it's a small, small pond 
                    that we swim in." Coffin went to that seminar 29 years ago and 
                    found he had the tools and ability to do the job in Belfast. 
                    His daughter Sigrid saw him working, but never thought she'd be 
                    in his studio too.

                    BELFAST RANGEWAY PROJECT

                    Belfast has 17 public shore access points or paths, often referred 
                    to as rangeways. The Allyn Street marker is the first of at least 
                    two, and hopefully more, permanent art installations in a series of 
                    split-rock gateways on the public paths to the shore or river edge. 
                    Developed by Stockton Springs artist Douglas Coffin. Coffin, one of 
                    the few traditional stone letter cutters in the country, felt that a 
                    simple approach tying all the rangeways and rights of way together 
                    was best. Coffin states in his proposal that such a "gate" suggests 
                    "walking from the present into the past, through these ancient 
                    rangeways, through the stone that Belfast is built on, from land 
                    towards the water that Belfast first thrived on." The large granite 
                    piece selected for this first installation, purchased through JC Stone 
                    in Washington, was quarried in York.
